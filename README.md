# Transaction-Level Verilog support for Vim

The *vim-tlv-mode* plug-in adds support for Transaction-Level Verilog (TLV for
short) to the [Vim text editor] [vim]. The plug-in is intended to provide
everything needed to efficiently develop TLV code in Vim:

 * File type detection
 * Syntax highlighting (including an optional color scheme)
 * Smart indentation
 * Checking for syntax errors (work in progress)

Each of the features outlined above is discussed in more detail below.

*Please note that Transaction-Level Verilog is in the process of being launched
as this document is written so I can't provide any public references yet, but
stay tuned: As soon as TLV has been launched I will provide references here.*

## Install & first use

Unzip the [most recent ZIP archive] [download-tlv-mode] of the *vim-tlv-mode* plug-in inside your Vim profile directory (usually this is `~/.vim` on UNIX and `%USERPROFILE%\vimfiles` on Windows), restart Vim and execute the command `:helptags ~/.vim/doc` (use `:helptags ~\vimfiles\doc` instead on Windows).

If you prefer you can also use [Pathogen] [pathogen], [Vundle] [vundle] or a similar tool to install and update the *vim-tlv-mode* plug-in using a local clone of [the git repository] [github-tlv-mode].

Now try it out: Edit a `*.tlv` file and inspect the syntax highlighting in `\TLV` code blocks! You can also play around with the smart indentation to get a feel for how it works.

## Features

### File type detection

Transaction-Level Verilog files are detected in two complementary ways:

1. Files with the `*.tlv` filename extension;
2. Files whose first line consists of the mandatory file format line.

If either of the two conditions above is met the file type detection kicks in.
What this basically means is that you should never have to manually activate
the file type or syntax highlighting; it will be done for you automatically.

### Syntax highlighting

The syntax highlighting mode differentiates between three types of code regions:

1. The first type of region is marked at its start with the line `\SV`, these
   regions contain lines of [SystemVerilog] [sv] code that are passed through
   (unprocessed and uninterpreted) to the translated SystemVerilog file. These
   regions are highlighted using Vim's [SystemVerilog syntax highlighting
   support] [sv_syntax] (included in Vim's runtime distribution as the
   `systemverilog` file type).

2. The second type of region is marked at its start with the line `\TLV`, these
   regions contain lines of Transaction-Level Verilog code. **This is where the
   syntax highlighting for Transaction-Level Verilog code kicks in and where
   most of the syntax highlighting logic of *vim-tlv-mode* is concentrated.**

3. The third type of region is marked at its start with the line `\SV_plus`,
   these regions contain lines of SystemVerilog code with TLV signal
   references.

#### Syntax highlighting of M4 macros

The TLV processing chain runs [M4] [m4] as an independent preprocessor before
any other processing takes place so M4 macros can be used anywhere (although
they are intended to provide functionality for `\TLV` and `\SV_plus` regions).
Because of this the *vim-tlv-mode* syntax script uses Vim's [M4 syntax
highlighting support] [m4_syntax] to highlight M4 macros embedded in TLV files.

#### Recommended color scheme included

There is a recommended color scheme for editing Transaction-Level Verilog code
and *vim-tlv-mode* contains a Vim color scheme script called (you guessed it
:-) *tlv* that provides this recommended color scheme to Vim.

Of course you are free to decide whether to use this color scheme or not, the
choice is up to you. The syntax highlighting mode is intended to work well with
other Vim color schemes as well.

### Smart indentation

The *vim-tlv-mode* plug-in uses Vim's ['indentexpr'] [indentexpr] option to
implement smart indentation that understands TLV scope rules and automatically
increases the indentation level as needed.

### Checking for syntax errors

To compile TLV code you need the `sandpiper` compiler. When the *vim-tlv-mode*
plug-in sees that you have the `sandpiper` compiler installed it will
automatically run the compiler every time you save a TLV file. If the compiler
reports syntax warnings or errors a [location-list-window] [llw] pops up to
show you an overview of compiler messages. When you click on a recognized line
in the location list window you'll automatically jump to the line in the TLV
file where the message was reported.

Please note that this feature is still in development (not finished yet) so for
now the automatic syntax checking is disabled by default. The to-do list in the
file `TODO.md` contains more details (refer to the version control repository
on GitHub).
